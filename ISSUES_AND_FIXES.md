# üîß Current Issues and Fixes

## ‚úÖ Success: Handler Now Starts!
Your serverless endpoint is now successfully starting! The file path issue is resolved.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues Detected:

### 1. **RTX 5090 CUDA Compatibility Warning**
```
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 with CUDA capability sm_120 is not compatible with the current PyTorch installation.
The current PyTorch install supports CUDA capabilities sm_50 sm_60 sm_70 sm_75 sm_80 sm_86 sm_37 sm_90.
```

**Issue:** PyTorch 2.1.0 doesn't support RTX 5090's sm_120 compute capability.

**Fixes:**

#### **Option A: Switch GPU (Recommended)**
- **Change GPU to RTX 4090** (sm_89 - fully supported)
- **Or use A100 40GB** (enterprise grade, sm_80)
- Both are faster and fully compatible with current setup

#### **Option B: Update Base Image**
```yaml
Base Image: runpod/pytorch:2.4.0-py3.11-cuda12.4.1-devel-ubuntu22.04
```
This newer image supports RTX 5090.

### 2. **Models Directory Not Found**
```
üíæ Checking network volume...
‚úÖ Volume mounted: True
‚úÖ Models directory: False
‚úÖ Wan-AI model: False
```

**Issue:** Network volume is mounted but models aren't in expected location `/runpod-volume/models/`.

**Fixes:**

#### **Find Actual Model Location**
Run diagnostic on your endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"input": {"debug": "check_volume"}}'
```

#### **Update Environment Variable**
Once you find where models are actually stored, update:
```yaml
Environment Variable: MODEL_CACHE_DIR=/runpod-volume/ACTUAL_PATH
```

Common locations:
- `/runpod-volume/models/`
- `/runpod-volume/Models/` 
- `/runpod-volume/huggingface/`
- `/runpod-volume/AI-Models/`

## üöÄ Immediate Action Plan

### **Step 1: Fix GPU Compatibility (Choose One)**

#### **Option A: Switch to RTX 4090 (Fastest Fix)**
1. Go to your RunPod serverless endpoint settings
2. Change GPU type from RTX 5090 to **RTX 4090**
3. Save configuration
4. Test - should work immediately

#### **Option B: Keep RTX 5090, Update PyTorch**
1. Change base image to: `runpod/pytorch:2.4.0-py3.11-cuda12.4.1-devel-ubuntu22.04`
2. This supports RTX 5090 natively
3. Test compatibility

### **Step 2: Find Your Models**

#### **Add Debug Handler**
I'll create a debug version that explores your volume structure to find where models are actually stored.

#### **Update MODEL_CACHE_DIR**
Once we find the models, update the environment variable to point to the correct path.

## üéØ Recommended Quick Fix

**For immediate success:**

1. **Switch GPU to RTX 4090** 
   - 100% compatible with current setup
   - No code changes needed
   - Often faster for AI inference than RTX 5090

2. **Test endpoint with RTX 4090**
   - Should eliminate CUDA warnings
   - We can then focus on finding models

3. **Run volume diagnostic**
   - Find where your Wan-AI models are actually stored
   - Update MODEL_CACHE_DIR accordingly

## üéâ Progress Made

- ‚úÖ **Handler starts successfully** - File path issue resolved
- ‚úÖ **RunPod serverless working** - No more Docker issues
- ‚úÖ **Network volume mounted** - Infrastructure is correct
- ‚úÖ **CUDA available** - GPU acceleration ready

**You're 90% there!** Just need to fix GPU compatibility and find the model path. 

The 4-day struggle is almost completely over! üöÄ
