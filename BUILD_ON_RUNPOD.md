# 🚀 Build Docker Image on RunPod (Network Issue Workaround)

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
Local Docker builds are failing due to network timeouts downloading base images. 
**Solution**: Build directly on RunPod with their fast, reliable network.

## 🏗️ **RunPod Build Strategy**

### **Step 1: Create RunPod Build Instance**
1. **Go to RunPod Console** → Pods → Deploy
2. **Select Template**: Docker (has Docker pre-installed)
3. **Hardware**: Any GPU (we just need network + compute)
4. **Attach Network Volume**: Your `ai-models-kiss-video` volume
5. **Start Pod**

### **Step 2: Upload Code to RunPod**
```bash
# Method A: Git clone (if code is on GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/nandtjm/runpod-kiss-video-api.git
cd runpod-kiss-video-api

# Method B: Upload via RunPod File Manager
# Upload your local files through RunPod web interface
```

### **Step 3: Build Image on RunPod**
```bash
# On RunPod instance (fast network!)
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile.volume \
    -t nandtjm/kiss-video-generator:volume-ready .

# This will complete in 5-10 minutes on RunPod's network
```

### **Step 4: Push to Docker Hub**
```bash
# Login to Docker Hub from RunPod
docker login
# Enter your Docker Hub credentials

# Push the built image
docker push nandtjm/kiss-video-generator:volume-ready
```

### **Step 5: Stop Build Pod**
- Stop the RunPod build instance to save costs
- Your image is now on Docker Hub ready for deployment!

## 🎯 **Benefits of RunPod Build**
- ✅ **Fast Network**: No timeout issues
- ✅ **Reliable**: Professional infrastructure  
- ✅ **Same Architecture**: Linux/AMD64 target platform
- ✅ **Cost Effective**: Pay only for build time (~$0.50)

## 🚀 **Alternative: Use Existing Image**

If you want to skip building entirely, I can create a **generic volume-ready image** that works with any pre-loaded volume:

```dockerfile
# Ultra-lightweight base that mounts any volume
FROM python:3.10-slim
# Install minimal dependencies
# Copy generic model loader
# Mount volume at runtime
```

## 💡 **Recommendation**

**Option A**: Build on RunPod (most reliable)
**Option B**: Use pre-built generic image (fastest)
